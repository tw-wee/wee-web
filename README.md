Web application for Wee project
----------------

some docs:
* webpack-dev-middleware,"The webpack-dev-middleware is a small middleware for a connect-based middleware stack. It uses webpack to compile assets in-memory and serve them. When a compilation is running every request to the served webpack assets is blocked until we have a stable bundle. "[https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-middleware.html](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-middleware.html)
* webpack-hot-middleware, "This module is only concerned with the mechanisms to connect a browser client to a webpack server & receive updates. It will subscribe to changes from the server and execute those changes using webpack's HMR api. Actually making your application capable of using hot reloading to make seamless changes is out of scope, and usually handled by another library.
